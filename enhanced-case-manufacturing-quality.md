## Statistical Solution Framework

### Phase 1: Baseline Data Collection

**Data Collection Protocol:**
Using our [Standard Deviation Calculator](/calculators/standard-deviation) for process analysis:

**Resistor Tolerance Measurements (Sample Week):**
Target: 1000Ω ± 5Ω (0.5% tolerance)

**Day Shift Measurements (Ω):**
1002.3, 998.7, 1001.5, 999.2, 1003.1, 997.8, 1000.9, 1001.7, 998.5, 1002.6

**Statistical Analysis:**
- **Mean**: 1000.63Ω
- **Standard Deviation**: 1.89Ω  
- **Range**: 1003.1 - 997.8 = 5.3Ω
- **Assessment**: Within tolerance but high variability

### Phase 2: Control Chart Implementation

**X-bar and R Chart Development:**
Using our [Mean Calculator](/calculators/mean) for ongoing monitoring:

**Control Limits Calculation:**
- **Upper Control Limit (UCL)**: Mean + 3σ = 1000.63 + (3 × 1.89) = 1006.3Ω
- **Lower Control Limit (LCL)**: Mean - 3σ = 1000.63 - (3 × 1.89) = 994.9Ω
- **Target Line**: 1000.0Ω

**Process Capability Analysis:**
- **Cp**: Specification width / Process width = 10Ω / (6 × 1.89Ω) = 0.88
- **Assessment**: Process not capable (Cp < 1.33 required)

### Phase 3: Root Cause Analysis

**Variance Component Analysis:**
Using our [Variance Calculator](/calculators/variance):

**Sources of Variation:**
1. **Machine calibration drift**: 35% of total variance
2. **Environmental temperature**: 25% of total variance  
3. **Operator technique differences**: 20% of total variance
4. **Raw material variation**: 15% of total variance
5. **Measurement system error**: 5% of total variance

**Statistical Significance Testing:**
- **Between-shift differences**: Statistically significant (p < 0.001)
- **Machine-to-machine variation**: Significant (p < 0.05)
- **Temperature correlation**: r = 0.73 (strong correlation)
