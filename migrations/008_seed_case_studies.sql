'# Strategic GPA Improvement: From 2.8 to 3.5 in Two Semesters

## The Challenge
College junior Sarah faced academic probation with a cumulative GPA of 2.8, needing to raise it to 3.5 for graduate school admission while managing a challenging course load and limited time.

## The Statistical Approach
Using GPA calculations and weighted averages, Sarah developed a systematic improvement strategy that optimized her course selection and study time allocation based on credit hour weights and realistic grade expectations.

## Key Results
- Cumulative GPA increased from 2.8 to 3.52 over 4 semesters
- Achieved 3.8+ semester GPA in final 3 consecutive semesters  
- Successfully admitted to preferred graduate program

This case demonstrates how understanding weighted averages and statistical planning can create dramatic academic turnarounds when time is limited.',
