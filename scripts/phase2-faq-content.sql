-- FAQ 2: Range Interpretation
INSERT INTO slim_content (slug, type, title, summary, content, status, priority, target_tool, tags, difficulty, reading_time) VALUES (
'how-to-interpret-range-values',
'faq',
'How do I interpret range values?',
'Learn to properly interpret range as a measure of data spread and variability.',
'Range represents the difference between maximum and minimum values, providing the simplest measure of data spread.

## Range Interpretation Guidelines:

### Relative to Context:
- **Small Range**: Data points cluster tightly (consistent)
- **Large Range**: Data points spread widely (variable)
- **Context Matters**: A 5-point range means different things for test scores vs temperatures

### Comparison Standards:
- **Historical Data**: Compare current range to past periods
- **Industry Benchmarks**: Evaluate against sector standards
- **Theoretical Limits**: Consider practical minimum/maximum bounds

## Practical Examples:

### Student Test Scores:
- Range = 15 points (85-100): Moderate variation, most students performing well
- Range = 40 points (60-100): High variation, significant performance differences

### Daily Temperatures:
- Range = 8°F: Mild temperature variation
- Range = 25°F: Significant daily temperature swings

### Product Quality:
- Range = 0.1mm: Excellent manufacturing consistency
- Range = 2.0mm: Poor quality control, needs improvement

## Limitations to Consider:
- **Outlier Sensitivity**: Single extreme value can dramatically increase range
- **Sample Size Effect**: Larger samples tend to have larger ranges
- **No Middle Information**: Doesn''t show how data distributes between min/max

## When Range is Most Useful:
- Quick quality checks
- Initial data exploration
- Simple tolerance verification
- Small dataset analysis',

**Regular Mean** (incorrect):
- Math A, English B, PE A = (4.0 + 3.0 + 4.0) ÷ 3 = 3.67

**Weighted Mean** (correct):
- Math A (4 credits), English B (3 credits), PE A (1 credit)
- (4.0×4 + 3.0×3 + 4.0×1) ÷ (4+3+1) = 29÷8 = 3.63

The weighted calculation properly reflects course importance.

## Best Practices:
- **Document Weights**: Clearly explain why specific weights were chosen
- **Verify Total**: Ensure weights sum to 100% or 1.0
- **Review Regularly**: Update weights as priorities change
- **Consider Context**: Use weights that reflect real-world importance',

- **Environmental Studies**: 50+ measurements per site

## Factors Affecting Sample Size:

### Data Variability:
- **Low Variability**: Smaller samples adequate
- **High Variability**: Larger samples needed
- **Unknown Variability**: Start with n=30, assess, then expand

### Precision Requirements:
- **Rough Estimates**: Smaller samples acceptable
- **Precise Estimates**: Larger samples required
- **Critical Decisions**: Maximum reasonable sample size
- **Regulatory**: Often specified minimum requirements

### Population Characteristics:
- **Homogeneous Population**: Smaller samples sufficient
- **Heterogeneous Population**: Larger samples needed
- **Rare Events**: Very large samples required
- **Subgroup Analysis**: Additional samples per subgroup

## Statistical Power Considerations:

### Effect Size:
- **Large Effects**: Small samples may suffice
- **Medium Effects**: Moderate sample sizes needed
- **Small Effects**: Large samples required
- **Unknown Effects**: Conservative large sample approach

### Confidence Level:
- **90% Confidence**: Smaller samples acceptable
- **95% Confidence**: Standard requirement
- **99% Confidence**: Larger samples needed
- **99.9% Confidence**: Very large samples required

## Practical Sample Size Rules:

### Quick Decision Rules:
- **n < 10**: Very unreliable, avoid if possible
- **n = 10-29**: Basic calculations only, limited interpretation
- **n = 30-99**: Good for most descriptive statistics
- **n = 100-299**: Reliable for most applications
- **n ≥ 300**: High confidence in results

### By Analysis Complexity:
- **Simple Comparisons**: n ≥ 30 per group
- **Multiple Comparisons**: n ≥ 50 per group
- **Complex Modeling**: n ≥ 100 per variable
- **Predictive Models**: n ≥ 10-20 per predictor

## Calculator-Specific Guidance:

### Mean/Median Calculators:
- **Minimum**: 5 values for basic calculation
- **Stable**: 30+ values for reliable estimates
- **Precise**: 100+ values for narrow confidence intervals

### Standard Deviation/Variance:
- **Minimum**: 10 values (but unreliable)
- **Acceptable**: 30+ values for reasonable estimates
- **Reliable**: 100+ values for stable measures

### GPA Calculators:
- **Individual**: All completed courses
- **Comparative**: 20+ students minimum
- **Institutional**: 100+ students for meaningful analysis

## When Sample Size is Limited:

### Small Sample Strategies:
1. **Acknowledge Limitations**: Report sample size constraints
2. **Use Appropriate Statistics**: Median over mean for small samples
3. **Increase Precision**: Use exact methods when available
4. **Bootstrap Methods**: Resample to estimate precision
5. **Combine Data**: Pool with similar studies if appropriate

### Quality Over Quantity:
- **Data Quality**: Better to have fewer high-quality measurements
- **Representative Sampling**: Ensure sample represents population
- **Measurement Precision**: Invest in accurate measurement methods
- **Documentation**: Record data collection procedures

## Red Flags for Insufficient Sample Size:

### Warning Signs:
- **Extreme Sensitivity**: Results change dramatically with single data point
- **Unrealistic Precision**: Standard error seems too small
- **Inconsistent Results**: Repeated sampling gives very different answers
- **Domain Knowledge Conflict**: Results contradict established knowledge

### When to Collect More Data:
- **High Stakes Decisions**: Critical business or policy choices
- **Regulatory Requirements**: Specified minimum sample sizes
- **Scientific Publication**: Peer review standards
- **Unusual Results**: Surprising findings need larger samples for confirmation

## Cost-Benefit Analysis:

### Diminishing Returns:
- **First 30 Points**: Major improvement in reliability
- **30-100 Points**: Moderate improvement
- **100-300 Points**: Smaller but meaningful improvement
- **300+ Points**: Minimal improvement for most applications

### Resource Allocation:
- **Time Constraints**: Balance sample size with project timeline
- **Budget Limits**: Consider cost per additional data point
- **Opportunity Cost**: Resources spent on sample size vs. other improvements

Remember: It''s better to have a smaller, high-quality, representative sample than a larger, poor-quality sample. Always consider your specific context and requirements when determining adequate sample size.',
