'Use mean for normally distributed data without outliers, as it provides the mathematical average. Use median for skewed distributions or data with outliers, as it represents the middle value and is less affected by extreme values. Consider your data distribution and analysis purpose when choosing.

## When to Use Mean:
- Data is normally distributed
- No significant outliers present
- Need the mathematical average
- Working with continuous numerical data

## When to Use Median:
- Data is skewed or has outliers
- Working with ordinal data
- Need a robust measure of center
- Data has extreme values that might distort the mean

## Example:
Income data often uses median because high earners can skew the mean upward, making median more representative of typical income.',

'# Statistical Results Interpretation Guide

Transform statistical calculations into meaningful insights and actionable information.

## Central Tendency Interpretation

### Mean Analysis:
- **Purpose**: Mathematical average of all values
- **Sensitivity**: Affected by outliers and extreme values
- **Best Use**: Normal distributions without outliers
- **Communication**: "On average..." or "The typical value is..."

### Median Analysis:
- **Purpose**: Middle value when data is ordered
- **Resistance**: Not affected by outliers
- **Best Use**: Skewed distributions or ordinal data
- **Communication**: "Half the values are above/below..."

### Comparison Strategy:
- **Mean ≈ Median**: Symmetric distribution
- **Mean > Median**: Right-skewed, outliers pull mean up
- **Mean < Median**: Left-skewed, outliers pull mean down

## Dispersion Interpretation

### Standard Deviation:
- **Low SD**: Data clusters tightly around mean (consistent)
- **High SD**: Data spreads widely from mean (variable)
- **Rule of Thumb**: ~68% of data within 1 SD of mean
- **Communication**: "Values typically vary by ±X from the average"

### Variance:
- **Technical Use**: Squared standard deviation
- **Practical Meaning**: Measure of overall variability
- **Comparison**: Higher variance = more unpredictable

### Range:
- **Simple Measure**: Maximum - Minimum
- **Limitation**: Affected by extreme outliers
- **Use Case**: Quick variability assessment

## Practical Translation

### Business Context:
- **Customer Satisfaction**: "Average rating of 4.2/5 with consistent responses (SD=0.3)"
- **Sales Performance**: "Monthly sales vary significantly (SD=$15K) around the $50K average"
- **Quality Control**: "99% of products within specification (3-sigma quality)"

### Academic Context:
- **Test Scores**: "Class average of 85% with most students scoring 80-90%"
- **GPA Analysis**: "Cumulative GPA of 3.4 shows consistent performance"

## Communication Best Practices

1. **Avoid Jargon**: Use plain language for non-technical audiences
2. **Provide Context**: Compare to benchmarks or expectations
3. **Include Both**: Report central tendency AND variability
4. **Visual Support**: Use charts to illustrate findings
5. **Actionable Insights**: Connect statistics to decisions

## Common Pitfalls

- Don''t report mean without considering distribution shape
- Don''t ignore variability measures
- Don''t assume correlation implies causation
- Don''t over-interpret small sample results',
