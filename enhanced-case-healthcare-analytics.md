Metropolitan General Hospital's Emergency Department implemented a comprehensive statistical analysis program to reduce patient wait times and improve care delivery efficiency. Through data-driven insights and systematic process improvements, the hospital achieved a 40% reduction in average wait times while improving patient satisfaction scores and clinical outcomes.

## Hospital Background

**Metropolitan General Hospital Profile:**
- Type: Level 1 Trauma Center, 450-bed urban hospital
- Emergency Department: 24/7 operation, 85,000 annual visits
- Service area: Urban population of 1.2 million residents
- Staff: 45 physicians, 120 nurses, 60 support staff
- Average daily census: 235 patients

**Initial Challenges:**
- Average wait time: 4.2 hours (national average: 2.8 hours)
- Patient satisfaction: 2.3/5.0 (bottom 10th percentile)
- Left without being seen (LWBS) rate: 8.4%

## Problem Analysis

### Statistical Assessment of Wait Times

**Baseline Data Collection (3-month period):**
Using our [Mean Calculator](/calculators/mean) and [Standard Deviation Calculator](/calculators/standard-deviation):

**Patient Wait Time Distribution:**
- **Mean wait time**: 4.2 hours
- **Median wait time**: 3.8 hours  
- **Standard deviation**: 2.1 hours
- **Range**: 0.5 to 12.8 hours
- **95th percentile**: 8.9 hours

**Variability Analysis:**
- **Coefficient of variation**: 50% (high variability indicating process inconsistency)
- **Peak hour wait times**: 6.8 hours average (2-8 PM)
- **Off-peak wait times**: 2.1 hours average (2-6 AM)

### Root Cause Statistical Analysis

**Correlation Analysis Results:**
1. **Time of arrival vs wait time**: r = 0.68 (strong positive correlation)
2. **Patient acuity vs wait time**: r = -0.45 (higher acuity = shorter wait)
3. **Staffing levels vs wait time**: r = -0.72 (more staff = shorter wait)
4. **Bed availability vs wait time**: r = -0.81 (more beds = shorter wait)

**Regression Analysis:**
Using multiple regression to predict wait times:
**Wait Time = 2.1 + 0.8(Hour of Day) - 0.3(Nurses on Duty) - 0.5(Available Beds) + 0.2(Patient Acuity)**
- **R-squared**: 0.73 (model explains 73% of wait time variation)
- **Statistical significance**: p < 0.001 for all variables

## Statistical Solution Framework

12:00-18:00: 12.4 patients/hour (σ = 3.9)
18:00-24:00: 15.2 patients/hour (σ = 4.1)
```

**Seasonal Variations:**
- **Winter months**: 15% higher volume (flu season)
