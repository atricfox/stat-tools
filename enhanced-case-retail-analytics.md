## Statistical Solution Framework

### Phase 1: Customer Lifetime Value Analysis

**CLV Calculation Model:**
Using advanced statistical modeling to predict customer value:

**CLV Formula Components:**
- **Average Order Value (AOV)**: $47.50
- **Purchase Frequency**: 3.7 transactions/month
- **Customer Lifespan**: 28 months (average)
- **Gross Margin**: 22%

**Customer Lifetime Value Calculation:**
CLV = (AOV × Purchase Frequency × 12 months × Customer Lifespan × Gross Margin)
CLV = ($47.50 × 3.7 × 12 × 2.33 × 0.22) = $1,140 per customer

**Segment-Specific CLV:**
- **High-Value Segment**: $3,685 CLV (323% above average)
- **Regular Segment**: $1,025 CLV (90% of average)
- **Occasional Segment**: $185 CLV (16% of average)

### Phase 2: Predictive Analytics Implementation

**Purchase Prediction Models:**
Using statistical regression analysis:

**Model 1: Next Purchase Timing**
**Days Until Next Visit = 8.2 - 0.3(Previous Basket Size) + 0.1(Days Since Last Visit) - 0.2(Customer Segment)**
- **R-squared**: 0.67 (model explains 67% of variation)
- **Mean Absolute Error**: 2.1 days
- **Practical accuracy**: 78% within 3-day window

**Model 2: Basket Size Prediction**
**Predicted Basket = $32.50 + $8.20(Customer Segment) + $0.15(Days Since Last Visit) + $2.30(Day of Week Factor)**
- **R-squared**: 0.72
- **Mean Absolute Error**: $8.40
- **Practical accuracy**: 71% within $10 range

**Model 3: Product Affinity Analysis**
Using association rule mining and correlation analysis:
- **Bread → Milk**: 67% confidence, 0.23 lift
- **Fresh Produce → Organic Products**: 43% confidence, 1.8 lift
- **Weekend Shopping → Premium Brands**: 38% confidence, 1.6 lift

### Phase 3: Inventory Optimization

**Demand Forecasting Model:**
Using time series analysis and seasonal decomposition:

**Statistical Components:**
- **Trend**: 2.3% annual growth
- **Seasonal variation**: 15% peak (holidays), -12% trough (post-holiday)
- **Weekly patterns**: 35% higher weekend demand
- **Weather correlation**: r = 0.45 for fresh produce

**Safety Stock Calculation:**
Using statistical methods to optimize inventory levels:
**Safety Stock = Z-score × √(Lead Time) × Standard Deviation of Demand**

**Example: Fresh Produce Category**
- **Average weekly demand**: 1,240 units
- **Standard deviation**: 186 units
- **Lead time**: 2 days (0.29 weeks)
- **Service level target**: 95% (Z = 1.645)
- **Safety Stock**: 1.645 × √0.29 × 186 = 165 units
