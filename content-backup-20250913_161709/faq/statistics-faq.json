      "question": "What's the difference between mean and median?",
      "answer": "The mean is the arithmetic average calculated by summing all values and dividing by the count. The median is the middle value when data is arranged in order. The key difference is that mean is sensitive to extreme values (outliers), while median is not. For example, in the dataset [1, 2, 3, 4, 100], the mean is 22 but the median is 3. Use mean for normally distributed data without outliers, and median for skewed data or when outliers are present.",

      "question": "When should I use mean vs median?",
      "answer": "Use the mean when: 1) Your data is normally distributed (bell-shaped), 2) You don't have significant outliers, 3) You need to include all values in the calculation, 4) You're working with interval or ratio data. Use the median when: 1) Your data is skewed, 2) You have outliers that would distort the mean, 3) You're working with ordinal data, 4) You want a more robust measure of central tendency. For income data, median is often preferred because a few high earners can skew the mean upward.",

      "question": "What's the difference between sample and population standard deviation?",
      "answer": "The key difference is in the denominator: Population standard deviation divides by n (the number of data points), while sample standard deviation divides by n-1. This adjustment (called Bessel's correction) compensates for the fact that samples tend to underestimate population variability. Use population SD when you have data for the entire population (rare in practice). Use sample SD when working with a subset of data to estimate the population parameter (most common scenario). Our calculator supports both options.",

      "question": "What's the difference between weighted and unweighted GPA?",
      "answer": "Unweighted GPA uses a standard 4.0 scale where A=4.0, B=3.0, C=2.0, D=1.0, F=0.0, regardless of course difficulty. Weighted GPA adds extra points for advanced courses: typically +1.0 for AP/IB courses and +0.5 for Honors courses, resulting in scales up to 5.0 or higher. For example, an A in AP Calculus might be worth 5.0 instead of 4.0. Colleges consider both: unweighted GPA shows consistency, while weighted GPA reflects course rigor. Most colleges recalculate GPA using their own system.",
